abstract = { The ratings and narrative reviews for 3,144 motion pictures in Video Movie Guide 1989, by Mick Martin and Marsha Porter, were compared with those for the same movies in TV Movies and Video Guide, by Leonard Maltin. The correlation between these ratings was .67. The mean difference between these ratings was .55 points (stars) on a scale that ranged from zero stars to four stars. The critics' evaluations, as indicated by these ratings and reviews, differed markedly for approximately 6.3\% of the 3,144 movies, but they showed good or acceptable agreement for the remaining 93.7\% of the films. The critics' evaluations showed sufficient agreement to be of substantial value to viewers of movies. Critics showed the highest agreement for westerns. }

abstract={ESOC (the European Space Agency's Operation Centre) is experimenting with Agile and Scrum methodologies in its quest for improving productivity, enhancing project visibility and control, reducing time to market, improve software quality and increasing user satisfaction. In this article we present lessons learned from applying Agile in general and Scrum in particular to a number of projects, from applying a few Agile best practices to full Scrum. ESOC has traditionally developed its software using a waterfall life cycle mostly under Firm Fixed Price contracts, in this context using Agile brings challenges from project management, contracts and quality control perspective. Using a coaching approach, delivered by SixSq a Swiss-based company specialised in agile and Scrum coaching and development, the organisation has managed to accelerate its integration of Scrum, including industrial teams developing the software, and already yields positive results which are promising for the future.},
